Structure of /data/ana/Diffuse/GlobalFit_Flavor/
folder contains three main subfolders as follows:
    taupede :  This is where all i3 and hdf5 files are stored. Individual subfolders should have some README file to explain what each of them contains. If not, the naming of the folder should specify what it contains
    NNMFit_Configs :  Config files used in the analysis. Note that this is a folder where all files that were used at the end of the analysis are stored. This folder is child of /data/user/nlad/NNMFitStuff/FlavourFit/NNMFit_configs/  where many other configurations that were tested can be found. (Warning about parent folder, files/folders may be confusing and not very well documented)
    NNMFit_Datasets : This Folder contains NNMFit Dataframes used in the analysis
